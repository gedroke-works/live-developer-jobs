Simple frontend of a live developer jobs search application (mobile friendly). This is using a json document to simulate an API request.

Technology used: 
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Javascript
  
Tool used: 
  * Pen and paper (always)
  
Build process:
  * Navigation Bar
  * Search Bar 
  * Job tile with CSS grid
  * Filter job function
  * Fetch data from json document function 
  * Display function to show filtered jobs dynamicaly in the user interface
  * Using media queries to make this mobile friendly
  
What next ?: 

  * More customization of the design
  * Replace the json doc with a real live API to fetch jobs data
